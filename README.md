# MySQL_challenge_IMDB-
Using SQL data to make a full-blown movie website.

In first week's challenge, you've made your movie website. You've made them pretty, but they lack the proper amount of data to make them usable as sources of information.

Well the data is here: imdb.zip

Download it, create a new database for it and import it there.

Then use it.

The task
Use your old design and the given SQL data to make a full-blown movie website.

Whaaat?
You heard me. Right now you have all the necessary knowledge to make a website that could pick a figth with IMDB (if it had it's own data).

How to begin?
Create a new mysql database on your local server.
Download and unzip the data from here: imdb.zip.
Import the data into your database. In your terminal/command-line that can be done using the following line:

mysql -u username database_name < imdb.sql
        
Where username is the username for your database access (root ?) and database_name is the name you gave to the database you created.
Have a look at the database schema to get an idea of how the database looks: 
Make sure that your movie website runs in php (.php files)
Create a folder structure for your php files. You can use anything that makes sense to you or try to use our MVC framework's structure.
How to do it?
Good news is that the only kind of SQL query that you will need is a SELECT. No INSERTs, UPDATEs or DELETEs here.

Begin with the movie's detail page.
Make sure that the page is opened with a numeric id (unique identifier) in the URL address. The identifier will be a value from the column olumn imdb_id of the table imdb_movie.
When you have this identifier, use it to select the necessary data from the database - data from imdb_movie, imdb_movie_type and imdb_movie_status.
Once you know how to use JOINs, you can select the rest of the data about a movie as well.
Then try the same thing with imdb_person
Then try some movie and persons lists.
Go as far as you can. There is a lot of data in the database. Use your imagination.
