They are the flamboyant alcoholic Withnail and \"I\" (named \"Marwood\" in the published screenplay but not in the credits) as his relatively more level-headed friend and the film\'s narrator. Withnail comes from a privileged background and sets the tone for the friendship. They live in a filthy Georgian flat in Camden Town. Their only company at the flat is the local drug dealer, Danny.\r\n\r\nThe roommates squabble about housekeeping and leave to take a walk. In Regent\'s Park, they discuss the state of their acting careers and a possible country vacation, settling on a visit to Withnail\'s uncle Monty, who has a cottage near Penrith. After a near fight with a large and belligerent Irishman, they return home to prepare for their trip. They visit Monty that evening at his luxurious Chelsea house. Monty is a melodramatic aesthete and Marwood realises he is homosexual. The three briefly drink together as Withnail casually lies to Monty about his acting career and lies that Marwood went to Eton. Before leaving, Withnail arranges to borrow the cottage.\r\n\r\nThe countryside is beautiful, but the weather is cold and often inclement, the cottage is without running water or light, they have no food and the locals are unwelcoming – in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends. They see Jake prowling around their cottage. Marwood suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed in the interest of safety, but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail becomes paranoid that the poacher is going to come after them and climbs under the covers with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has been stranded with a punctured tyre.\r\n\r\nMonty has brought supplies and persistently comes on to Marwood. He offers to take them into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts it out of his mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood\'s advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and that the two of them have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven\'t slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Marwood finds that Monty has left for London, leaving a note of apology wishing them happiness together. They continue to argue about their behaviour and Monty. When Marwood receives a telegram about a callback from an earlier audition, he insists they return to London.\r\n\r\nAs Marwood sleeps, Withnail drunkenly speeds and swerves until pulled over by the police. Withnail is arrested for driving under the influence, and tries to falsify his urine sample. The pair return to the flat to find Danny and a stranger named Presuming Ed squatting there. Marwood calls his agent and discovers that he is wanted for the lead part in a play. The three, and Presuming Ed, get high smoking a huge cannabis joint. The celebration ends when Marwood learns they have received an eviction notice for unpaid rent, while Withnail is too high to care.\r\n\r\nMarwood prepares to leave for the station, turning down Withnail\'s request for one last drink. In Regent\'s Park in the rain, Marwood confesses that he will miss Withnail, but does not allow him to accompany him further to the station. Bottle of wine in hand, Withnail declaims \"What a piece of work is a man!\" from Hamlet to an uncomprehending pack of wolves behind a fence in the London Zoo. The camera watches as he turns and walks away into the gloomy distance, swinging the bottle, as the credits start to roll.',	'At the end of the 1960\'s, two substance-abusing, unemployed actors retreat to the countryside for a holiday that proves disastrous.'),

His mother Sarah Connor had been preparing him throughout his childhood for his future role as the Human Resistance leader against Skynet – the artificial intelligence that will be given control of the United States\' nuclear missiles and initiate a nuclear holocaust called \"Judgment Day\" on August 29, 1997 – but was arrested and imprisoned at a mental hospital after attempting to bomb a computer factory. Skynet sends a new Terminator, designated as T-1000, back in time to kill John. The T-1000 is an advanced prototype made out of mimetic poly-alloy (referred to as \"liquid metal\") that gives it the ability to take on the shape and appearance of almost anything it touches, and to transform his arms into blades and other shapes at will. The T-1000 arrives under a freeway, kills a policeman and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed T-800 (Model 101) Terminator to protect his young counterpart.\r\n\r\nThe Terminator and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet\'s history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity.[a] Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet\'s creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net processor that will form the basis for Skynet.\r\n\r\nSarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to Mexico, but after having a nightmare about Judgment Day, she instead sets out to kill Dyson in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring. Finding him at his home, she wounds him but finds herself unable to kill him in front of his family. John and the Terminator arrive and inform Dyson of the future consequences of his work. They learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged CPU and the right arm of the previous Terminator. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the Cyberdyne building, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy Dyson\'s lab. The police arrive and Dyson is lethally shot, but he detonates the explosives when he dies. The T-1000 relentlessly pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in a steel mill.\r\n\r\nThe T-1000 and the T-800 engage in physical combat, with the advanced model severely damaging its adversary. However, the T-800 is able to bring itself back online by harnessing the heat from the steel mill. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah until the T-800 appears and shoots it into a vat of molten steel with an M79 grenade launcher, destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that to ensure that it is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to \"self-terminate\", although John begs the Terminator to reconsider its decision. It bids them farewell as it is lowered into the vat. The Terminator gives a tearful John a final thumbs-up as it disappears into the molten steel and shuts down. Sarah looks to the future with hope, musing that \"if a machine ... can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.\"',	'A cyborg, identical to the one who failed to kill Sarah Connor, must now protect her ten year old son, John Connor, from a more advanced cyborg.'),

The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in California. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-eze and allow him to take The King\'s place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but ends up lost in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road.\r\n\r\nAfter being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater), McQueen is ordered by the town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer, Sally Carrera, requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day, but turns out shoddy, and he is forced to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he befriends several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the \"Fabulous Hudson Hornet\", a three-time Piston Cup winner, whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954, and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen\'s location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen\'s whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.\r\n\r\nAt the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen\'s mind is not fully set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc\'s fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks\' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen\'s sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rust-eze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.',	'A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen gets waylaid in Radiator Springs, where he finds the true meaning of friendship and family.'),

He is determined to use it to create an artistic piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can pour his whole self. Gathering an ensemble cast into an enormous warehouse in Manhattan\'s Theater District, he directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing them to live out their constructed lives. As the mockup inside the warehouse grows increasingly mimetic of the city outside, Caden continues to look for solutions to his personal crises. He is traumatized as he discovers Adele has become a celebrated painter in Berlin and Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele\'s friend Maria. After a disastrous fling with Hazel (the woman who works in the box office), he marries Claire, an actress in his cast, and has a daughter with her. Their relationship ultimately fails, and he continues his awkward relationship with Hazel, who is by now married with children and working as his assistant. Meanwhile, an unknown condition is systematically shutting down his autonomic functions one by one.\r\n\r\nAs the years rapidly pass, the continually expanding warehouse is isolated from the deterioration of the city outside. Caden buries himself ever deeper into his magnum opus, blurring the line between reality and the world of the play by populating the cast and crew with doppelgängers. For instance, Sammy Barnathan is cast in the role of Caden in the play after Sammy reveals that he has been obsessively following Caden for 20 years, while Sammy\'s lookalike is cast as Sammy. Sammy\'s interest in Hazel sparks a revival of Caden\'s relationship with her, leading Sammy to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nAs he pushes against the limits of his personal and professional relationships, Caden lets an actress take over his role as director and takes on her previous role as Ellen, Adele\'s custodian.

Finally, he prepares for death as he rests his head on the shoulder of an actress who had previously played Ellen\'s mother, seemingly the only person in the warehouse still alive. As the scene fades to gray, Caden says that now he has an idea of how to do the play when the director\'s voice in his ear gives him his final cue: \"Die.\"',	'A theatre director struggles with his work, and the women in his life, as he creates a life-size replica of New York City inside a warehouse as part of his new play.'),

He is assigned to audit an intentionally tax-delinquent baker, Ana Pascal, to whom he is attracted. On the same day, he begins hearing the voice of a woman omnisciently narrating his life but is unable to communicate with it. Harold\'s watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates, \"little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\". Worried by this prediction, Harold consults a psychiatrist who attributes the voice to schizophrenia, though they consider that if there really is a narrator, he should visit an expert in literature. Crick visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor, and relates his story. When Jules recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold\'s story, he encourages Harold to identify the author, first by determining if the work is a comedy or tragedy.\r\n\r\nAs Harold audits Ana, the two fall for each other, but when Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him because they could be viewed as a bribe, Ana tells him to leave, making Harold believe the story is a tragedy. On the advice of Jules, Harold spends the next day at home trying to control his destiny by doing nothing, but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew that mistook the building for an abandoned one. Jules believes that since Harold cannot control the plot, he should accept his impending death and enjoy whatever time he has left. Harold takes a vacation from work, develops his friendship with his co-worker Dave, fulfills his dream of learning to play the guitar, and dates Ana. Harold reassesses his story as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation, Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as author Karen Eiffel. Jules, an admirer of Karen\'s work, reveals that all of her books feature the main character\'s tragic death.\r\n\r\nKaren struggles from writer\'s block and researches ways to kill the character Harold to complete her next book. Her publisher sends an assistant, Penny Escher, to ensure the book is completed. Harold finds Karen through her tax records. When Karen learns that Harold experiences everything she writes, she is horrified by the thought that her books may have killed real people. She tells Harold she wrote a draft of his death, but has not typed it up yet; the events in the book manifest when she strikes the period key. Penny suggests Harold read the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold cannot bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules confirms its excellence, labeling it as Karen\'s masterpiece; Harold\'s death is integral to its genius. Though Harold is distressed over his fate, Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death: this one death, at least, will have a deeper meaning. Harold reads the manuscript, then returns it to Karen, telling her the death she has written for him is \"beautiful\" and she should keep it intact. He spends one last night with Ana.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Harold prepares to return to work, despite Karen\'s voice narrating as she types up her ending. Because Harold\'s watch is three minutes fast owing to the imprecise time given to him days ago, he reaches the bus stop early and watches as a young boy falls in front of the oncoming bus. Karen continues writing; Harold leaps from the curb and pushes the child out of the way, but is struck by the bus. Karen cannot complete the sentence confirming Harold\'s death, and Harold wakes up in a hospital, injured but alive. He learns that fragments of his wristwatch blocked the right ulnar artery in his body after the collision, saving his life. When Jules reads Karen\'s final manuscript, he notes that the story is weaker without Harold\'s death. Karen admits the flaw, but points out that the story was meant to be about a man that dies unexpectedly; with Harold sacrificing himself, the story would have lost its tragic impact. In place of Harold, his wristwatch—anthropomorphized throughout the film—is the character who died tragically.',	'An IRS auditor suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death.'),

Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son Tom, and daughter Murphy. Living in a post-truth society (Cooper is reprimanded at school for telling Murphy that the Apollo missions did indeed happen), Cooper encourages Murphy to carefully observe and record what she sees. They realize that a pattern of dust on the floor is created by gravity variations and not - as Murphy first believed - by a poltergeist. Decoding it as a set of geographic coordinates, Cooper and Murphy follow them to a secret NASA facility, where they are met by Cooper\'s former professor, Dr. Brand.\r\n\r\nBrand reveals that a wormhole mysteriously appeared near Saturn 48 years earlier, opening a pathway to a distant galaxy with potentially habitable planets. Twelve volunteers traveled through it, each assessing the suitability of a planet as humanity\'s new home. Volunteers Miller, Edmunds and Mann have sent back encouraging data from planets near a black hole called Gargantua. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the interstellar space station-like Endurance spacecraft, carrying 5,000 frozen embryos for a \"Plan B\": to colonize a habitable planet to ensure humanity\'s survival. The only option for the majority of humankind to survive is his continued work on a \"Plan A\" – a gravitational theory for propulsion that would allow a mass exodus from Earth. Cooper agrees to go, but does not explain the significance of the mission to Murphy. His departure devastates her.\r\n\r\nCooper\'s crew consists of the scientists Romilly, Doyle, and Prof. Brand\'s daughter Dr. Amelia Brand, as well as the robots TARS and CASE. Traversing the wormhole, they use a lander to investigate Miller\'s planet, where time is severely dilated (because of its proximity to Gargantua, one hour equals seven years on Earth), and the surface is covered in knee-high deep water. Finding only wreckage from Miller\'s expedition, Brand retrieves Miller\'s data just before a gigantic tidal wave hits, killing Doyle and water-logging the lander\'s engines. After returning to Endurance, they discover that 23 years have elapsed on Earth. With limited fuel to travel to only one planet, the crew chooses Mann\'s planet over Edmunds\', since Mann is still transmitting, despite Edmunds\' more promising data.\r\n\r\nOn Earth, Murphy Cooper is now a scientist and assisting Prof. Brand. On his deathbed, Prof. Brand admits that he never considered Plan A feasible and that Plan B was the only plan. In a recorded video session, Murphy Cooper notifies the crew of the death, accusing Prof. Brand\'s daughter and her own father of abandoning Earth. Despite Prof. Brand\'s assessment, she continues working on Plan A, knowing she needs more data on gravitational singularities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Cooper, Brand and Romilly land on Mann\'s planet. Mann assures the crew that the frozen planet is habitable despite its ammonia-laden atmosphere. While surveying the planet, Mann attempts to kill Cooper, revealing that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper\'s Ranger and heads for Endurance. While Romilly is killed by a booby trap set by Mann, Brand rescues Cooper with a lander and they race to Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance in the process. Cooper and Brand use their lander to stabilize the ship.\r\n\r\nCASE warns Cooper that Endurance is slipping toward Gargantua\'s pull. Cooper decides to use Gargantua as a gravitational slingshot to propel the ship toward Edmunds\' planet, but their proximity to Gargantua means more time will elapse on Earth. To shed weight, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves toward the black hole, so that Brand and CASE can complete the journey. Slipping past the event horizon, Cooper and TARS eject from their respective spacecraft and find themselves inside a tesseract, which resembles streams of bookshelves capable of peering into Murphy\'s bedroom at different periods in her life. Cooper surmises that the tesseract and wormhole were created by humans of the future to enable communication with Murphy, and that he was her \"ghost\" all along. Using the second hand on the watch he gave her before he left, Cooper relays the quantum data Murphy needs to solve the gravitational equation.\r\n\r\nFollowing a turbulent ejection from the tesseract, Cooper awakens in a space habitat orbiting Saturn. He reunites with his daughter, now an elderly woman nearing death, who has discovered a solution to plan A. At his daughter\'s behest, Cooper and TARS leave to rejoin Brand and CASE who are preparing a new human colony on Edmunds\' planet, which was found to be habitable.',	'A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in space in an attempt to ensure humanity\'s survival.'),

Paddy tries to convince him that he has changed, but to no avail. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where, in less than 1 minute, he beats unconscious a professional fighter named Pete \"Mad Dog\" Grimes (Erik Apple), in a fight which is filmed via a cell phone\'s video camera and later uploaded to the Internet, where it goes viral. Tommy learns about a winner-takes-all mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta in which the winner will receive $5,000,000. Tommy asks his father to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to reconcile their relationship.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tommy\'s older brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher and former MMA fighter, is struggling to provide for his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two daughters. He had to mortgage his house to pay for his younger daughter\'s open heart surgery, and is now in danger of losing everything. To increase his income, Brendan battles amateur fighters for money. Rumors of Brendan\'s secret life spread around the school, and the superintendent suspends him without pay. Left with no other option, Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement. Later that night, Paddy comes over to meet up with Brendan in his driveway to try to reconcile with him, but to no avail. Before Paddy leaves, he tells Brendan that Tommy is back in town.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving at the tournament, Brendan discovers that Tommy has also entered. It is revealed that Tommy is still angry at Brendan for staying behind for Tess when Tommy and their mother left Paddy; Tommy was left to care for their mother when she became terminally ill. Brendan claims that he could not help having been in love with Tess and that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the video of Tommy beating \"Mad Dog\" attracts the attention of a Marine whose life Tommy saved in Iraq. The Marine tells the press about Tommy\'s heroism, and Tommy becomes a national hero. However, Tommy\'s records surface from the Corps and reveal that he deserted the military after his entire unit was killed in a friendly fire bombing. Tommy had been using his mother\'s maiden name as his own surname in order to evade arrest for his desertion. He reveals to have pledged to give his winnings to the widow of one of his fallen friends. The military police will take him into custody after the tournament is over.\r\n\r\nOver two nights, Brendan and Tommy have contrasting fortunes: Tommy quickly and brutally knocks out opponents, while Brendan is outmatched physically but utilizes Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to force grappling submissions. In the semi-final match, Brendan is matched up with undefeated Russian wrestler Koba (Kurt Angle), who dominates him in two rounds. In round three, Brendan swings for the fences, making the bout a back and forth battle. In the closing moments of the final round, Koba takes Brendan\'s back from the clinch and Brendan goes for a rolling kneebar. As Koba attempts to escape the position, Brendan quickly reverses and readjusts the kneebar narrowly winning by submission. Tommy meets Mad Dog Grimes in the semifinals and Tommy once again knocks him unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe night before the final day, Paddy attempts to talk to Tommy about his actions in Iraq. Tommy angrily dismisses his father, who relapses and starts drinking again. Seeing his terrible pain, Tommy calms and comforts him. In the end the brothers are the last fighters remaining in the tournament, and despite Brendan\'s desire to reconcile, Tommy shows no interest in doing so. Tommy wins the first two rounds, but Brendan eventually dislocates Tommy\'s shoulder with an omoplata arm-lock. As the fourth round starts, Brendan insists Tommy give up. As Tommy continues trying to knock Brendan out, Brendan unloads a barrage of strikes, trying to end the fight. Tommy goads Brendan to continue hitting him as the fourth round ends. At the start of round five, Brendan refuses to fight, but Tommy persists. Brendan realizes he has to force him to submit and he traps Tommy in a rear naked choke. As they struggle on the canvas, Brendan apologizes to Tommy and tells him that he loves him. After some hesitation, Tommy submits. The reconciled brothers exit the ring as their father looks on smiling.',	'The youngest son of an alcoholic former boxer returns home, where he\'s trained by his father for competition in a mixed martial arts tournament - a path that puts the fighter on a collision course with his estranged, older brother.'),

Aibileen\'s best friend is the plain-spoken Minny Jackson, the maid of the socialite Leader and controlling Hilly Holbrook. Minny cooks well.\r\n\r\nHilly believes that \"coloreds\" have different diseases from the whites. A tornado comes through town so Hilly wants Minny to go out into the weather to use the new bathroom. Minny uses the household bathroom, is fired by Hilly and people are told she stole property. Aibileen tells Skeeter her stories are worth telling when Minny is fired.\r\n\r\nMinny finds a job with Celia, wife of Johnny Foote--Hilly\'s former beau. Celia cannot cook a lick but she can butcher her own chickens. Minny comes upon Skeeter\'s visiting Aibileen and joins in the book project effort. Skeeter is advised by her book editor at Harper & Row, Elaine Stein, that the stories of two maids are not enough. Potential retribution from the maid\'s employers hinders others from joining the project. Aibileen tells Skeeter about the pain she experiences about her son being fatally crushed working on the job and his body being dumped at the \"colored\" hospital.\r\n\r\nHilly has Yule May, Minny\'s replacement, arrested for thievery. More maids start with the book project.\r\n\r\nRetribution from the employers is on the minds of Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny if the stories are recognized in the book. Minny reveals her \"terrible awful” that she did to Hilly. Its inclusion in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade denial that the book is about Jackson.\r\n\r\nSkeeter confronts her mother Charlotte about the leaving of their elderly maid Constantine just before Skeeter\'s return to Jackson. Constantine\'s daughter Rachel arrives at the Phalen home, embarrasses Charlotte while she is entertaining the Daughters of America, so Charlotte\'s attempt to save face is to ask maid and daughter to leave the property. Before Charlotte could contain the situation, Constantine has died.\r\n\r\nThe book is published anonymously, and it is a success. Celia lets on that she knows about the terrible awful. Hilly attempts to intimidate Skeeter through threat of legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that \"that\" is in chapter 12. Charlotte lets on that she knows about the terrible awful. Charlotte and Skeeter are reconciled when Charlotte tells her how proud she is about her courage, the book and the job offer in New York City.\r\n\r\nJohnny tells Minny that it is not too difficult to know that there has been a change at the house, how appreciative he is about her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has job security. This act gives Minny the courage to take her children away from her abusive husband.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to seek revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, with Hilly present and trying to frame Aibileen for theft and imprisonment. But Aibileen stands up to Hilly, reminding her that she knows about the terrible awful and that the success of the book shows that she has writing skills, that there is much time in prison to write, and that paper is free. She dismisses Hilly as a godless woman who will never know peace or happiness, shaming Hilly into backing down. Aibileen retires and goes to live with Minny and her children.',	'An aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African American maids\' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.'),

While he and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the company\'s camp is attacked by an Arikara war party. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on foot to Fort Kiowa, as traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.\r\n\r\nGlass is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and left close to death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts.\r\n\r\nAfter the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk. Fitzgerald stabs him to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits he lied. When Fitzgerald and Bridger meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells him that Glass died and Hawk vanished.\r\n\r\nGlass begins an arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude self-surgery and eludes the pursuing Arikara who are looking for the Chief\'s kidnapped daughter, Powaqa. Glass encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc who says that \"revenge is in the Creator\'s hands.\" The men share bison meat and travel together. After a hallucinogenic experience, Glass discovers Hikuc hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills two hunters, and steals Hikuc\'s horse, leaving his canteen behind. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives the night by eviscerating the horse and sheltering inside its carcass.\r\n\r\nA French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa and Bridger recognizes his canteen as Glass\'s. Believing it stolen, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald, realizing Glass is alive, empties the outpost’s safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Enraged, Henry orders Bridger arrested, but Glass vouches that he was deceived and reveals that Fitzgerald murdered his son. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nAfter the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes and kills Henry. Glass uses Henry\'s corpse on his horse as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc\'s words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. The chief fatally scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass. Heavily wounded, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.',	'A frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting team.'),
